1. Project Overview
Description: This project is a simple text editor, like a basic Notepad app, built with Python and Tkinter.
Purpose: The editor lets users perform basic text management functions: creating, opening, editing, and saving text files. Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI library, provides the graphical interface.
2. Features
New File: Clears the text area so users can start typing a new document.
Open File: Opens a dialog allowing users to browse and open existing .txt or other types of text files.
Save File: Saves the current text document either as a new file or by updating an existing file.
Exit: Closes the application window.
3. Requirements
Python 3.x: Needed to run the program. If you don’t have it, you can download it from python.org.
Tkinter: Tkinter is typically included with Python installations, so no additional installation is necessary.
4. Setup and Running the Application
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Download the Script: Save the Python code as a .py file (e.g., text_editor.py).
Open the Code:
You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to open and run the script. Make sure to have the Python extension installed in VS Code, as it helps with code execution and debugging.
Alternatively, you can run the code directly from a terminal or command line.
Run the Code: The README provides commands to run the program in a terminal:
python text_editor.py (or python3 text_editor.py if your system requires it).
5. Usage Instructions
Once the editor is running, a blank window with a “Text-Editor” title will appear.
File Menu Options:
New: Clears the current text to start a fresh document.
Open: Opens a file browser to select and load an existing text file.
Save: Opens a file dialog to save the current document. You can save as a new file or overwrite an existing one.
Exit: Closes the application.
6. Screenshot Section
Purpose: This section is a placeholder for a visual example. When the application is open, you can take a screenshot of the interface to include in this section.
7. Contributing
Purpose: This is an invitation for others to report bugs, improve the code, or add new features. If your project is open-source, users or contributors can help enhance its functionality.
8. License
Purpose: Specifies that the code is available for open use and modification, typically under the MIT License (or your chosen license). This grants others permission to use, modify, and share the code.
